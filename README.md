Uncertainty About Audience Preferences - New studios don’t have brand loyalty or existing franchises.

Limited Market Experience - New studios don’t have insider knowledge or industry history to guide decisions.

Timing the Release - Releasing a movie at the wrong time (e.g., during a blockbuster season dominated by competitors) can hurt performance.
